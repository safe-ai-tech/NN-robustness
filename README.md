# safety and security analysis for autonomous vehicles
This repository contains a technical report on safety and security analysis for autonomous vehicles (AVs). It is a report written with the intention of helping researchers and developers working on their own AV designs and neural networks (NNs), to those analyzing safety and security threats to NNs, to those just wondering what goes into a robustness evaluation---learn more about methods for evaluating NN robustness. We intend to update this document from time to time in order to match the currently accepted best practices in the research and industrial community.
## Abstract
The development of autonomous vehicles is proceeding rapidly and promises safer and more efficient roads. However, safety and security problems remain, and the problem of drop out, that is the handover of vehicle control to a human driver presents a major problem. Hazard identification studies have been performed for most autonomous vehicles under development. Nevertheless there remain problems of analysis methodology, which need to be solved before full confidence in autonomous vehicle controllers for mixed traffic can be obtained.This report discusses the development of a range of methods to analyze autonomous vehicle safety and security. The approach is both theoretical and practical, in that proposed methods are tested using a development of an actual autonomous vehicle, actually a design for a 1‚ÅÑ4 scale vehicle.
